It should not be a valid csharp code, however the
/* comments */could be tested here pretty well
// I'm a comment line
/* I'm a comment line */
/* We are two comments *//* on the same line */
/* We are two comments */// on the same line */
/* We are two comments  on one line */ /* with a space between */
/* We are two comments  on one line */a/* with a code between */
"/* I'm not a comment at all, but a string */"
"// I'm not a comment at all, but a string"
code here // then a comment
code here /* then a comment */
/* comment here */ then some code
/*
next line is a comment, not a whitespace

*/
// next three lines are whiespaces



this is a code /*
this is a comment
and this is a comment */
/*
*/ good bye code /*
